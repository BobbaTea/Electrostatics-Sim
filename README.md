# Electrostatics-Sim
PhPhPhet-like simulation to replicate point charges and their movement with graphical visualizations of the electric fields, voltage, and potential energy. This project has been done in collaboration with Andrew Ji

## Instructions for Ph3et

Positive/Negative Charges: +/- Keys (without holding shift)
 
Place a Charge: Click
 
Dissection Pin While Placing: P Key (toggle)
 
Selection of Particle: Hold S and hold cursor over charge
 
Clear all Selections: Press S and D keys at same time
 
Delete Charge: Hold D and hold cursor over charge
 
Field Lines On/Off: F Key (toggle)
 
Information Boxes: I Key (toggle)
 
Pause/Resume Simulation: Space (toggle)
 

Note: If charges go off-canvas, they will be deleted for memory conservation. Use the charge counter in the top-left to see how many charges there are in total.

Note: When a charge is selected, three bars will appear in the bottom left. The blue bar is kinetic energy (invisible when velocity is 0 or when a particle is placed while simulation is paused), the green bar is electric potential energy, and the red bar is total energy, or the sum of kinetic and electric potential energies.
